This course uses Seumas Macdonald's [Linguae Graecae Per Se Illustrata](https://github.com/seumasjeltzz/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata) (aka LGPSI) with some enhancements/additions. 


# Pronunciation

I'll be using a Restored Imperial Koine pronunciation. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94B26pJM2fg) is a good video you can watch to see what this is like if you want. 

# Contents

- [Κεφάλαιον τὸ πρῶτον](chapter_01.html), [audio](https://youtu.be/CH2t4L-dCWk?si=h7__RP-HEEXJ8HMT)
