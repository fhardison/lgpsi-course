# General notes

If a week doesn't have specific homework, try to do at least the following things:

1. Read the chapter we disucssed in class and try to understand the the overall meaning. Don't worry if you don't understand every word. Just try to get the general idea of the chapter. 
2. Read the chapter again more slowely and try to focus on figuring out things you don't understand from context. You can also lookup words if needed. Here is a free, online Ancient Greek Lexicon you can useL <https://lsj.gr/wiki/Main_Page>
3. Read the chapter again. 

I would recommend listening to the audio for the first and third reading to help develop your listening and pronuciation skills. If you want an extra challenge, you could try listening to the audio without reading after the third time through the chapter.
